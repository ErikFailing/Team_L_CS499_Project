This directory is the entirety of our unity project.

Most of the files are unity specific and will be hard to decipher unless the project is being opened in unity.

However, the code & scripts can be accessed either by opening the "Team_L_CS499_Project.sln" in 
microsoft visual studio or entering the "Assets/Scripts/" directory and opening individual scripts.
A lot of the code's functionality depends on compenents in unity. Functions, methods and
variables may appear to never be referenced but they are actually being referenced. This is because they are being
referenced inside the Unity Editor and outside the scope of the Microsft Visual Studio environment.

Please reach out to me at ewf0002@uah.edu if you have any trouble running the executable or understanding the code.
